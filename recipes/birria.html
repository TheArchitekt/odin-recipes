    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Birria is a popular Mexican dish that is traditionally made with lamb meat, but it is common for people to use beef today since it is more affordable and easier to find.</p>
    <p>There are a few different ways to enjoy Birria. The first is as “consome” which is a type of soup, or stew using dried chiles and other spices. For that variety, the meat is shredded and served in the soup. That is why it is important for the meat to be cooked until it is very tender. The consome is served with diced onion and cilantro, salsa, and lime juice. It is popular at baptisms, weddings, and holiday parties.</p>
