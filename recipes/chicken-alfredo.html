    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A creamy chicken alfredo that's easy and takes plain, bland, store-bought sauce and make it more than restaurant-worthy.</p>

    <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 16oz packages thin spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 15oz jars alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped broccoli</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
        <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li>
    </ol>
